            Have you ever heard of the Snake video game? Battlesnake is the same thing except instead of you pressing the arrow buttons on your keyboard, your task is to <strong>create a program to play the game for you!</strong>. With a <strong>team of 1-4</strong> people, you will create a Battlesnake bot to compete against other teams' bots in a bracket-style tournament. It is a beginner-friendly challenge, suitable for people of all skill levels. Whether it's intricate algorithms or Artificial Intelligence, you can use anything you'd like to create your Battlesnake!
