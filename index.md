            Have you ever heard of the Snake video game? Battlesnake is the same thing except instead of you pressing the arrow buttons on your keyboard, your task is to **create a program to play the game for you!**. With a **team of 1-4** people, you will create a Battlesnake bot to compete against other teams' bots in a bracket-style tournament. It is a beginner-friendly challenge, suitable for people of all skill levels. Whether it's intricate algorithms or Artificial Intelligence, you can use anything you'd like to create your Battlesnake!
        </p>

            The Battlesnake [official website](https://docs.battlesnake.com/) provides tons of useful information and tips to help you set up the bot and create your Battlesnake!

# What's Next?
Build your battlesnake! Work with your team to create a Battlesnake that tries to survive the snake arena for as long as possible. Make sure to take advantage of the loads of helpful resources provided on the Battlesnake website.

Remember, your Battlesnake needs to:

1. Respond to the basic [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/api) to fetch the game state and tell it what move your snake wants to make. (Make sure your server responds to each API call within **500 milliseconds**)
2. Not run into the walls, other snakes, or yourself.
3. Eat food! (your snake will die if it doesn't eat food for a long period of time)
4. Be a representation of your team's intelligence and creativity! You can use virtually any kind of algorithm you'd like (Artificial intelligence, graph theory, just to name a few). Your team's spirit is planted in your snake :) Make sure to have fun building your snake.
