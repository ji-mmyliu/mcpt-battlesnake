# What's Next?
Build your battlesnake! Work with your team to create a Battlesnake that tries to survive the snake arena for as long as possible. Make sure to take advantage of the loads of helpful resources provided on the Battlesnake website.

Remember, your Battlesnake needs to:

1. Respond to the Battlesnake API to fetch the game state and tell it what move your snake wants to make. (Make sure your server responds to each API call within **500 milliseconds**)
2. Not run into the walls, other snakes, or yourself.
3. Eat food! (your snake will die if it doesn't eat food for a long period of time)
4. Be a representation of your team's intelligence and creativity! You can use virtually any kind of algorithm you'd like (Artificial intelligence, graph theory, just to name a few). Your team's spirit is planted in your snake :) Make sure to have fun building your snake.
