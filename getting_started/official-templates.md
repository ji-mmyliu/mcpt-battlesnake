Be sure to check out the [**quickstart tutorial**](https://docs.battlesnake.com/quickstart) from the Battlesnake website.

The Battlesnake site offers [**official templates**](https://docs.battlesnake.com/starter-projects) in the following popular languages:
1. [Python](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-python)
2. [Javascript](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-javascript)
3. [Typescript](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-typescript)
4. [Go](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-go)
5. [Rust](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-rust)

**Important:** if you are using Java, please head to our [Java quickstart page](/getting_started/java.html) instead.

If you're unsure of how to use the templates, here's a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/IA7CeGRfuNE) from the admins.
